# Prolog Interpreter for Swift
A lightweight Prolog interpreter written in pure Swift.

This project includes a library for combinatory parsing (though only of regular grammars currently, recursion has to be handcoded by implementing the `Parser` protocol).

## Building
Run `swift build`.

## Testing
Run `swift test`.
